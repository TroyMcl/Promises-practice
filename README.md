# promises-practice
Practice your asynchronous Nodejs code with Promises

# Description

An outline repo that gives you a place to solidify your concept understanding and syntax of nodes asynchronous promises.

# Directions
Fork the repo and run npm install. Follow the directions provided above each function to step through the repo.

Start working through the with promise chains to begin with. When promise chaining, don’t nest your promises, keep everything on the same ‘level’. When you have finished with promise chains, you can refactor to the newer async/await syntax. There are solution branches for both promise chains and async await.

# Notes

Each function invocation can be seen in a console.log. This will log a promise to your terminal, not any data. This is because we are running asynchronous code in a synchronous node environments. If you want to see your data you will need to add console.logs inside your promises. Pay attention to what is console.logged, and the order of our console.logs, as it is an important part of understanding how to write your code in an actual server.
